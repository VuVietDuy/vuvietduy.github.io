# What is Decision tree

A decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It has a hierarchical tre structure which consists of a root node, branches, internal nodes and leaf nodes. It works like a flowchart help to make decisions step by step where:

- Internal nodes represent attrubute tests
- Branch represent attribute values
- Leaf nodes represent final decisions or predictions

Decision tree are widely used due to their interpretability, flexibility and low preprocessing needs
