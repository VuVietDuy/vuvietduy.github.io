## 1. Understand the Basics

Text prompts are a fundamental way for users to interact with generative language models, which aim to generate the text sequence of words that are most likely to follow from the given input text. To put it simply, it's like asking the model

## 2. Identify Prompt Components

When constructing a prompt, it can be helpful to identify its underlying components. These components include

- Instructions: guide the model on what to do.
- Primary content is the main text being processed
- Examples demonstrate desired behavior
- Cues act as jumpstarts for the output
- Supporting content provides additional information to influence the output

## 3. Craft Clear Instructions

Instructions are commonly used in prompts and guide the model's behavior. Be specific and leave as little room for interpretation as possible. Use analogies and descriptive language to help the model understand your desired outcome

## 4. Utilize Example

## 5. Pay Attention to Cueing

## 6. Test Arrangements

## 7. Give the Model an "Out"

## 8. Be mindful of token limits

## 9. Mitigate Harm with Responsible AI

## 10. Experiment and Iterate
